## Overview of the Project

### Simple Calculator using Python and Tkinter
This is a basic **Calculator** application built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. The calculator allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application provides a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
- **Dynamic Result Display:** The result is automatically displayed in a read-only text field.
- **Input Validation:** The program checks for invalid inputs and handles division by zero by displaying appropriate error messages.
- **Responsive Layout:** The layout is structured using tkinterâ€™s grid layout, making it easy to expand and adjust.

## How It Works

The application opens a window where users are prompted to enter two numbers in entry fields. Below the input fields are buttons to perform different arithmetic operations:

- **Add**
- **Subtract**
- **Multiply**
- **Divide**

When a user clicks a button, the result of the operation is displayed in a read-only entry box below the buttons.

### Program Flow:
1. The user enters two numbers.
2. The user selects an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
3. The result of the operation is calculated and displayed in the read-only result box.
4. If the input is invalid (non-numeric) or the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is displayed.
